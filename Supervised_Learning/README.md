# Supervised Learning Project

## Introduction

This project is focused on implementing and exploring supervised learning algorithms in Python. Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, making it possible to predict the output for new, unseen data.

## Features

- Implementation of various supervised learning algorithms:
  - Decision Trees
  - Ensemble
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Perceptron
  - Gradient descent
  - KNN
  - Neural Networks
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques
- Evaluation metrics for model performance
- Examples with real-world datasets

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.x installed
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
